## Geometry problem
Small video on the following problem : Can you find 4 points in the plane such that the distance between each pair is an odd integer?
I found the proof quite elegant, so I decided to animate it. 
**Note**: The problem can be generalized to n-th dimension using roughly the same arguments.
